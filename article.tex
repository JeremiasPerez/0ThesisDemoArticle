\section{Introduction}

%Describe the practice in which the problem addressed appears
Analyzing problems is critical for the success of any project.....
    
%Describe the practical problem addressed, its significance and its causes
A major problem within Problem analysis is that PhD students poorly analyze problems. This problem is of particular concern as it is now well established that it can lead to limit of the creative search space \cite{Kokotovich2008}.\textbf{ Moreover, this problem is of particular concern as it can lead to risk of solving a pseudo-problem. } lack of a clear output can be a contributing factor to this problem. \todo{Is the lack of guidelines a posible cause?}
    
%Summarise existing research including knowledge gaps and give an account for similar and/or alternative solutions to the problem

    
%Formulate goals and present Kernel theories used as a basis for the artefact design
In this work, we address 1 main cause: lack of a clear output. 
    
%Describe the kind of artefact that is developed or evaluated
This article presents a novel artefact
    
%Formulate research questions

    
%Summarize the contributions and their significance

      
%Overview of the research strategies and methods used
This article has followed a Design Science Research approach.

%Describe the structure of the paper
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: 

%Optional - illustrate the relevance and significance of the problem with an example
